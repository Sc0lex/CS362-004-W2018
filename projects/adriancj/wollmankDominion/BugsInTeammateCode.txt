Title:
	Bug 1 - 'handCount' not decremented in adventurerFunc
Product:
	wollmankDominion/dominion.c
	Forked from "https://github.com/aburasa/CS362-004-W2018"
Classification:
	Moderate Bug
Platform:
	Windows 10 w/ PuTTY 0.67 for SSH into 'flip1'
	GNU bash, version 4.2.46(2)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
Description:
	I was performing a unit test on the adventurerFunc that handles the effect of 
	the Adventurer card. In doing so, I explicitly created a set of deck cards that 
	would force drawing of more than two cards by placing only two treasure cards in
	the deck with an assortment of non-treasure cards in between. After calling
	adventurerFunc, the discard does not contain the expected non-treasure cards. 
	Debugging and code inspection of dominion.c revealed that line 1225 performs no
	action, although it is commented such that it indicates an intention to remove the
	card from the player's hand and is a suspected cause of the problem.

	The bug is moderate because if the player has additional actions for some reason, cards
	that should be discarded will still be in the hand, making the Adventurer card more
	powerful than intended. However, since only non-treasure cards are added to the hand,
	this is should only affect rounds in which a player has additional actions available.
Reproduction:
	Reproducible anytime a non-treasure card must be drawn to reveal the required
	two treasure cards per the Adventurer action.

	Play an adventurer card when the player's deck does not have two consecutive
	treasure cards to be drawn next. The player's hand will retain the non-treasure
	cards instead of being placed in the discard array of the game state immediately.
Expected Result:
	Drawn non-treasure cards should go into the player's discard pile
Actual Result:
	Drawn non-treasure cards go into the player's hand

Title:
	Bug 2 - Smithy is trashed instead of discarded when played
Product:
	wollmankDominion/dominion.c
	Forked from "https://github.com/aburasa/CS362-004-W2018"
Classification:
	Major Bug
Platform:
	Windows 10 w/ PuTTY 0.67 for SSH into 'flip1'
	GNU bash, version 4.2.46(2)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
Description:
	I was performing a unit test on the smithyFunc that handles the effect of the 
	Smithy card. The player draws three cards as expected, but the Smithy card does
	not end up in the discard pile for the player. Instead, the card is trashed 
	completely. Debugging and inspection of the code at line 1245 of dominion.c 
	reveals that the trash flag '1' is big specified for the discard rather than the
	'0', which the discard function documentation suggests would indicate that the card
	should not be trashed.
	
	This is a major bug because it causes the loss of a card from a player's deck. I.e.
	every time a player plays a Smithy, they lose it - significantly compromising the 
	game play.
Reproduction:
	This occurs every time a Smithy card 
Expected Result:
	Smithy card should be in the player's discard pile at the end of the turn
Actual Result:
	The Smithy card is no longer in the players hand, deck or discard pile
